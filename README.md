# Benchmark_OS


Hi, 


I am currently working on a new project. The titlle tell almost everythings, i would like to add some details.


- This will not be an os for customer, like windows, mac OS, or even linux.
- I don't want to add a graphical interface at the time (but in the futur why not)
- THIS IS A PROJECT FOR FUN

My goal here, is to create somekind of live OS, that can benchmark a computer.


At the moment I d'ont know if it is possible and how to do it, but we will see.
